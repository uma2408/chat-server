**Overview of the Code: Client-Server Chat Application:**

This Java-based Client-Server Chat Application demonstrates how to use sockets and multithreading to create a system where multiple clients can connect to a server and exchange messages in real time.

1. Purpose of the Application

The server acts as a central hub for communication, allowing clients to send and receive messages.
Each client connects to the server, sends messages, and receives updates (e.g., messages from other clients).

2. Server Functionality

File: ChatServer.java

Role: Listens for incoming client connections and facilitates message broadcasting.

**Key Features:**

Client Connection Management:

Listens for connections on a specified port (e.g., 12345).
Each connected client is handled on a separate thread (ClientHandler).

Broadcasting Messages:

Messages from one client are broadcast to all connected clients.
Uses a synchronized set (clientSockets) to maintain all active connections.

Multithreading:

Each client gets a dedicated thread for handling its communication with the server.

3. Client Functionality

File: ChatClient.java

Role: Connects to the server, sends user input, and displays messages broadcast by the server.

**Key Features:**

Server Connection:

Connects to the server on a specific host (localhost) and port (12345).

Sending Messages:

Reads user input from the console and sends it to the server.

Receiving Messages:

Runs a separate thread to listen for server messages continuously.

User Interaction:

Displays messages from the server in real time.

4. How It Works

Server Start:
The server listens for client connections on a specific port.
Each client connection is added to a shared list of active clients.

Client Connection:
Clients connect to the server using its IP and port.
Clients can send messages to the server.

Message Flow:
A client sends a message to the server.
The server broadcasts the message to all connected clients.

Multithreading:
The server uses separate threads to handle multiple clients simultaneously.
Each client runs a separate thread to listen for server messages without blocking user input.

6. Key Classes and Methods
Class/Method	Description
ChatServer	Manages all client connections and broadcasts messages.
ClientHandler	A nested class in ChatServer to handle individual client communication.
ChatClient	Represents a client that connects to the server and exchanges messages.
broadcastMessage	Server method to send a message to all connected clients.
run	Executes the client communication logic in a separate thread.

8. Features of the Code

Simplicity:
Relies on basic Java features like Socket, ServerSocket, and Threads.
No external libraries are required.

Concurrency:
The server uses multithreading to handle multiple clients at the same time.
Real-time Communication:
Messages are broadcast immediately to all clients, enabling real-time chat.
10. Possible Enhancements

User Identification:
Assign usernames to clients for better chat visibility (e.g., "Alice: Hi there!").

Private Messaging:
Allow clients to send messages directly to specific users.

GUI:
Build a graphical user interface (e.g., using Swing or JavaFX) for a more user-friendly experience.

Persistence:
Store chat logs in a file or database for later reference.

Security:
Encrypt messages using SSL/TLS for secure communication.
